My partners worked on the files CornerDetection and CornerDetectionWithYellowBorder, which tried to learn where the four corners of each card were.

My primary focus was on the Segmentation file, which attempted to detect which pixels were the card and which were not. It then uses this guess to estimate where the corners of the cards are.  For this file, a link to an online version of the project on Google Colab is also available.
