# Portfolio
A place to put projects that I think are worth showing.
Many of these are school projects, and are no longer being worked on.


INCOMPLETE:
LMS - A prototype Learning Management System (like Canvas).  The front-end HTML/JS was provided to me, while I worked on the back-end server and database.
After the semester ended, I lost the database portion of this project, so at the moment this project is non-functional.
