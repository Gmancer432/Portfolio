# Portfolio
A place to put projects that I think are worth showing.
Many of these are school projects, and are no longer being worked on.

Pokemon Card Detection
I worked with a group to make an image recognition program that used deep learning to detect where pokemon cards were in an image.  The folder includes three project files and a report.

Simple Spreadsheet
A simple spreadsheet program I helped work on.

TankWars
A simple multiplayer tank game I helped work on.  This project has both server and client programs (server is required to play), and supports LAN multiplayer.

INCOMPLETE:
LMS
A prototype Learning Management System (like Canvas).  The front-end HTML/JS was provided to me, while I worked on the back-end server and database.
After the semester ended, I lost the database portion of this project, so at the moment this project is non-functional.  The C#/LINQ portion of the project is shown here if you'd like to take a look at it.
