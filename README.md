# Portfolio
A place to put projects that I think are worth showing.
Many of these are school projects, and are no longer being worked on.

Ghost Hunters
Currently only the build is provided, though source code may be given upon request.  The build may be downloaded at:
https://u1249865.github.io/u1249865github.io/
This is a Unity game I helped work on. It has support for single player and online multiplayer, as well as Windows desktop and VR.
This project ended up being a large exercise in implementing our code into a pre-existing system.  We unfortunately started the project without knowning as much about Unity as we would have liked, and as a result we weren't able to put in nearly everything we wanted to.

Pokemon Card Detection
I worked with a group to make an image recognition program that used deep learning to detect where pokemon cards were in an image.  The folder includes three project files and a report.

Simple Spreadsheet
A simple spreadsheet program I helped work on.

TankWars
A simple multiplayer tank game I helped work on.  This project has both server and client programs (server is required to play), and supports LAN multiplayer.

INCOMPLETE:
LMS
A prototype Learning Management System (like Canvas).  The front-end HTML/JS was provided to me, while I worked on the back-end server and database.
After the semester ended, I lost the database portion of this project, so at the moment this project is non-functional.  The C#/LINQ portion of the project is shown here if you'd like to take a look at it.
